Repository for Dougie Do! ZX Spectrum Next game

BETA Release

Currently the only outstanding elements of this game are:
- Finalisation of music

Once complete the game will be uploaded onto https://robgm.itch.io/.

The game was developed using CSpect. As a result I welcome all testers, but in particular testers that can test using a physical ZX Spectrum Next or an alternative such as a MiSTer.

All feedback will be gratefully received and incorporated into the final release; of particular interest is feedback relating to sound effects and whether they are clear and play in mono when run outside of an emulator.

**24/01/22 Update** - It appears there is an initialisation difference between emulation and real hardware. As a result an issue has been identified and a new executable resolving the problem will hopefully be released ASAP.

**30/01/22 Update** - Uploaded latest version incorporating fixes for physical Next compatibility.

**10/02/22 Update** - Uploaded latest version incorporating screen Y offset change. 

Thanks in advance.

Rob.
